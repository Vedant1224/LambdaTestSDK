# LambdaTestSDK
SDK For LambdaTest

# Description 
The LambdaTestSDK is a Java SDK designed to interact with LambdaTest's automation API and allow data from API calls to be stored as Java objects. This enables easy access to specific elements within the API responses, providing a structured and convenient way to work with the data.

# Installation
To use the LambdaTestSDK in your Java project, you can include it as a dependency in your project's pom.xml file.

# Usage

To use the LambdaTestSDK in your Java project, you can follow these steps:

1.Add the LambdaTestSDK dependency to your pom.xml file as shown in the installation section.

2.Import the necessary classes from the SDK into your Java files.

3.Create an instance of the relevant API class (e.g., ExtensionsAPI, UserFilesAPI) by providing your LambdaTest credentials.

4.Call the methods of the API class to interact with LambdaTest's automation API and handle the API responses as Java objects.
